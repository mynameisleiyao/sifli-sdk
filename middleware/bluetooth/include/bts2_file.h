 *
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *      The bfwrite function writes up to count items, of size length each, from
 *      buffer to the output stream. The file pointer associated with stream (if
 *      there is one) is incremented by the number of bytes actually written. If
 *      stream is opened in text mode, each carriage return is replaced with a
 *      carriage-return 每 linefeed pair. The replacement has no effect on the
 *      return value
 *
 * INPUT:
 *     const void *buff: Pointer to data to be written.
 *     U32 size: Item size in bytes.
 *     U32 count: Maximum number of items to be written.
 *     void *stream: Pointer to FILE structure.
 *
 * OUTPUT:
 *     bfwrite returns the number of full items actually written, which may be
 *     less than count if an error occurs. Also, if an error occurs, the
 *     file-position indicator cannot be determined.

 *
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *      The bfread function reads up to count items of size bytes from the input
 *      stream and stores them in buffer. The file pointer associated with stream
 *      (if there is one) is increased by the number of bytes actually read. If the
 *      given stream is opened in text mode, carriage return每linefeed pairs are
 *      replaced with single linefeed characters. The replacement has no effect on
 *      the file pointer or the return value. The file-pointer position is indeterminate
 *      if an error occurs. The value of a partially read item cannot be determined.
 *
 * INPUT:
 *     void *buff: Storage location for data.
 *     U32 size: Item size in bytes.
 *     U32 count: Maximum number of items to be read.
 *     void *stream: Pointer to FILE structure.
 *
 * OUTPUT:
 *     bfread returns the number of full items actually read, which may be less
 *     than count if an error occurs or if the end of the file is encountered
 *     before reaching count. Use the feof or ferror function to distinguish a
 *     read error from an end-of-file condition. If size or count is 0, bfread
 *     returns 0 and the buffer contents are unchanged.

 *
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *      The bfseek function moves the file pointer (if any) associated with stream
 *      to a new location that is offset bytes from origin. The next operation on
 *      the stream takes place at the new location. On a stream open for update,
 *      the next operation can be either a read or a write. The argument origin
 *      must be one of the following constants, defined in Stdio.h.
 *
 * INPUT:
 *     void *stream: Pointer to FILE structure.
 *     long offset: Number of bytes from origin.
 *     int origin: Initial position.
 *
 * OUTPUT:
 *     If successful, bfseek returns 0. Otherwise, it returns a nonzero value.
 *     On devices incapable of seeking, the return value is undefined.
 *
 * NOTE:
 *     none.

/*----------------------------------------------------------------------------*
 *
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *      The bftell function gets the current position of the file pointer (if any)
 *      associated with stream. The position is expressed as an offset relative to
 *      the beginning of the stream.
 *      Note that when a file is opened for appending data, the current file position
 *      is determined by the last I/O operation, not by where the next write would
 *      occur. For example, if a file is opened for an append and the last operation
 *      was a read, the file position is the point where the next read operation would
 *      start, not where the next write would start. (When a file is opened for
 *      appending, the file position is moved to end of file before any write
 *      operation.) If no I/O operation has yet occurred on a file opened for appending,
 *      the file position is the beginning of the file.
 *      In text mode, CTRL+Z is interpreted as an end-of-file character on input.
 *      In files opened for reading/writing, fopen and all related routines check for a
 *      CTRL+Z at the end of the file and remove it if possible. This is done because
 *      using bftell and bfseek to move within a file that ends with a CTRL+Z may cause
 *      bftell to behave improperly near the end of the file.
 *
 * INPUT:
 *     void *stream: Target FILE structure.
 *
 * OUTPUT:
 *     bftell returns the current file position. The value returned by bftell may
 *     not reflect the physical byte offset for streams opened in text mode, because
 *     text mode causes carriage return每linefeed translation. Use bftell with bfseek
 *     to return to file locations correctly. On error, bftell returns 每1L. On devices
 *     incapable of seeking (such as terminals and printers), or when stream does not
 *     refer to an open file, the return value is undefined.
 *
 * NOTE:
 *     none.

 * DESCRIPTION:
 *      The bremove function deletes the file specified by path.
 *      All handles to a file must be closed before it can be deleted.
 *
 * INPUT:
 *     const char *path: Path of file to be removed.
 *
 * OUTPUT:
 *      Each of these functions returns 0 if the file is successfully deleted.
 *      Otherwise, it returns 每1 and sets errno either to EACCES to indicate
 *      that the path specifies a read-only file, or to ENOENT to indicate that
 *      the filename or path was not found or that the path specifies a directory.
 *      This function fails and returns -1 if the file is open.
 *
 * NOTE:
 *     none.
